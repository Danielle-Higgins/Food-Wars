Developed a fully responsive restaurant web application to explore the menu, learn more about the restaurant, and browse testimonials. Designed with a strong focus on user experience.

Website utilizes a fixed header where the user can jump from page to page. Users can browse through the site and hover over the different menu items, which will show you the price, the amount of stars, the name of the item, and the order button. It's a nice restaurant design focused on user experience.

## Optimizations

If/When I improve this project, I want to make it into a Full-Stack Application where it functions as a real restaurant website. Where the user can search for various restaurant locations, search for menu items, order those items or add them to their cart, and checkout. It would be a fun project to come back to.

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to create a layer hover effect on images where you can hover over an image and a layer appears on top of it that you can interact with. Also learned how to insert an icon inside of an element using absolute positioning.
